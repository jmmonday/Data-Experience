Hello!
I've included some of the code files for my work at the McGehee lab. The files in R were for organizing the data from a Two-Bottle choice experiment for nicotine 
consumption in mice for a presentation. The files also include some code necessary for the devices to collect the data, which was performed by a laser sensor attatched 
to the bottom of the sipper bottles.
